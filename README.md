# HSI-docs
Report of the Hyper Sprectral Imaging system development with LaTex.

- [`report.pdf`](https://github.com/HyperSpectral-Imaging/HSI-docs/blob/main/report.pdf) is the detailed documentation of the development of the system including hardware configuration and calibration procedures.
- [`manual.pdf`](https://github.com/HyperSpectral-Imaging/HSI-docs/blob/main/manual.pdf) is the software user manual.
- [`final.pdf`](/final.pdf) is a more concise version of the system development documentation. This is the one that is handed to MOST for review. It's suitable for anyone who want to have a in-depth knowledge of the system, but don't want to be overwhelmed by all the details in `report.pdf`. 
- [HSI Main Project API Documentation](https://cheng-posheng.gitbook.io/hsi-main-project-api-documentation/) has all the information if you wish to continue the development of the software. Refer to [this repo](https://github.com/HyperSpectral-Imaging/HSI-Main) for the LabVIEW source code.
- [`.init` file documentation](https://bencer.notion.site/init-file-documentation-for-HSI-system-f05871402b4142f085a79efb22f836e6) tells you how to edit and recalibrate initilization parameters if some modification are made to the system.
